# Steps #
- Installed Curl
- Ran into similar issue as before.

	- Needed to add .exe at the end of curl for it to work. Wasted soo much time looking up other solutions before i thought to try it.
  
- After downloading .txt file i opened it with Sublime Text 3.  This was when all the difficulty started.

	- When using the find/replace command i couldnot filter out the commands we were told to use.  
  
	- I made sure i had Regular Expression on and that Sublime Text was up to date.  Spend way too much time fiddling with this for it to work.  
  
	- I also re-installed it and rebooted my pc just to be sure.  Still couldnt get search results. (*Even searching words like "sam" or "to" showed no results even though i could actually see them in the text file). 
  
	- Eventually i gave up and skipped it for a few days.  Came back and it worked suddenly.
  
	- Not sure what fixed it but im glad it works.  (It might have been some setting that was saved from the last time i used sublime text for reading java. I dont know).  Finally finished trimming the txt file and converted it to a .csv file.
  
- This was hands down the hardest assignment for me even though the concept behind it is rather simple (just filter and replace). 

  - Heavily relied on copy-pasting code as the complex combinations of syntax was way too above me.



# Reflection questions: #
In your journal.md for this week, think about all of the little decisions you have to make about the material as you clean and transform it. 
What is the value of/for historians (regular historians) showing their work, as opposed to, or in contrast to, what digital historians have to do? 
Where is the scholarly value in showing your work - and contrast this with how youâ€™ve written history to date.

- By showing your work people can understand your interpetation/idea better.  By laying out the proccess that created your hypothesis it allows others to challenge your reasoning and create alternative theories aswell.
	- With digital historians, they can only show information which they believe to be relevant.  This was brought up in the first reading.  
	- The author stated that someone called her out for not publishing some extra information (which she deemed not relevant).  
	- I think, based off of the example above, that historians believe "showing your work" is an essencial part of being a Historian.
- The scholarly value comes from being able to fully understand a person's theory and have the information to fact-check their logic.  
The use of "showing your work" not only keeps people more honest, it also lets people pick a part their ideas/beliefs.
